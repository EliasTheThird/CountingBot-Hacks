# CountingBot-Hacks
The program provides a playful way to represent positive integers as a sum of ones, allowing users to visualize the concept of addition.

New in [v2]
- Added the functionality of copying the result to the clipboard automatically.
- Set an upper limit to the number, as the discord counting bot does not seem to accept anything higher.
